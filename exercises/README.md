## Tasks

1. Insertion sort (bisect search) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort
2. Selection sort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

## Extras

1. +10% Insertion sort (optimized linear search). Here we expect that instead
   of traversing the slice from left to right, you do it from right to left,
   swapping elements while `s[i] < s[j]`.
2. +50% Add benchmarks for every sort algorithm. Check the [benchmarking]
   section for tutorials and other useful info.
